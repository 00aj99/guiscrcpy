## Installation
[(skip)](#Features)

(Also called Step 0). Put a star on my repo. Gives support to #opensource and me!!
### Linux
For Linux, download the latest `guiscrcpy_linux-*` release, double click the file, and you are good to go.
As pre-requisite, you should do `sudo snap install scrcpy` to install the scrcpy engine.
### Windows
For Windows, the executable is compiled into an Installer. Download the #TODO
### MacOS
Unfortunately, I do not own a Mac device, and hence cant compile for one, but it is easy to build one. Read the [build instruction](#Build)


## Features
### Aim 

> It focuses on:

    lightness (native, displays only the device screen)
    performance (30~60fps)
    quality (1920Ã—1080 or above)
    low latency (35~70ms)
    low startup time (~1 second to display the first image)
    non-intrusiveness (nothing is left installed on the device)
   
   ~ from [scrcpy README](https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy)
guiscrcpy focuses on:
    
    independent add on controls
    faster execution (no need to waste time to think; oh, what was the command for changing bitrate, etc.)
    configuration writing
    one handed controls
    easy GUI
    
### Comparison

| Feature       | `guiscrcpy`   | other `*scrcpy*` alternatives  | commercial software   |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------- | 
| Speed         | Faster, as it is independent from scrcpy engine  | Mostly integrated into the engine, making a GUI layer (slower)| Contains Ads or is through Internet, (data charges are inclusive) |
| Language | Python  | C-alternatives | Binary (unknown) |
| Type | Open source (you can edit them) | Open source | Proprietary |
| Other | Can write configuration file and handle events like swipe up, swipe down, App-switch, volume up | Can handle all events which is using a forked version of scrcpy | Can do everything except swipes and pinches |
| Compatibility (PC) | Windows 7 (32/64) / MacOS / Linux   |  Windows 7 (32/64) / MacOS / Linux   | Windows 7 (32/64) / MacOS / Linux  |
| Compatibility (Mobile) | Android 5.0+ (given by scrcpy)| Android 5.0+ | Android 4.4+ |
| Base | scrcpy (original, created by @rom1v | forked scrcpy | no scrcpy |
| Keyboard Shortcuts | All the shortcuts which are mentioned by scrcpy | Unknown | Unknown |

### Requirements
All the requirements are the same as that of `scrcpy`. A copy of the requirements are given below.

The Android device requires at least API 21 (Android 5.0).

Make sure you [enabled adb debugging][enable-adb] on your device(s).

[enable-adb]: https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb.html#Enabling

On some devices, you also need to enable [an additional option][control] to
control it using keyboard and mouse.

[control]: https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy/issues/70#issuecomment-373286323


### Contents
The package includes four parts:

#### Main UI controller
![Main Window](/docs/images/main.png)

It handles all the pre - runtime features and gives flags to the `scrcpy` engine. It also includes a configuration writing system, which write the configuration file to the home directory, so `guiscrcpy` can read the information and run it, without
giving flags quite often.


#### Toolkit UI controller
<img src=/docs/images/toolkit.png>

The `toolkit` is an independent module, which is in
neither way connected to `scrcpy` or `guiscrcpy`, except for launching.
> NOTE: See [Issues: Unable to drag panel](#Issues)

#### Bottom Panel controller
![Bottom Panel](/docs/images/bottompanel.png)

The `bottom_panel` is an additional floating windows
that helps to do basic controlling like **Home Key, Back Key, Power Key**. This include the most important functions, one would like to do with an Android device.
The most important feature of this module, is that **it has no interference with the `scrcpy` SDL layer, and hence maximum speed**
> NOTE: See [Issues: Unable to drag panel](#Issues)

##### scrcpy engine
The scrcpy engine, is the classic v1.10 scrcpy, found on [scrcpy's github page by @rom1v](https://github.com/genymobile/scrcpy). On Windows release files, scrcpy, binary executable is also attached to make `PATH` problems easier to solve. On Linux, scrcpy has to be manually downloaded from `snap`

### Keyboard shortcuts

guiscrcpy includes all the shortcuts that scrcpy packages.
These are all the [keyboard shortcuts](https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy#shortcuts)

## Build
guiscrcpy can also be built from source. But that's easy as pie!
### Dependencies
* `PyQt5`
* `psutil`
* `qdarkstyle` (optional)

Before everything, make sure you have scrcpy on your path. You can Google it out, on how to do it.

Only Scrcpy 1.10
1. (Also called Step 0). Put a star on my repo. Gives support to #opensource!!
2. Install python3. If you don't have it install it from
[Python Software Website](https://python.org) or on Linux by <p>`sudo apt install python3.7`

3. Clone my git repo. or copy paste this to your _bash_ <p>`git clone https://github.com/srevinsaju/guiscrcpy`

4. Run the Python Package installer `pip` and run the commands below <p> `python3 -m pip install PyQt5 psutil` <p>

5. You can also run <p> `python3 -m pip install qdarkstyle` <p> if you require the dark breeze theme as shown in the image above.

6. So you are all set! Run the program by <p> `python3 __main__.py`

7. Read [Known Issues](#Issues) if you fall into some errors.


## Issues
### Linux (X Server)
For Linux operating systems, if python raises `Xlib>>ModuleNotFoundError`, then run <p>
`sudo apt install python3-xlib` <p>
`sudo apt install python3-qt5`

To use toolkit (development, on Linux only), run: <p>
`sudo apt install wmctrl xdotool`

### Some buttons not working
Some buttons like `clipboard`, `pinch in/out` are not enabled. But, however, you may enable it by recompiling the source code. I am looking forward for pinching on Android help / Documentation / links.

### Unable to drag Panel or Toolkit
[According to Issue #4](https://github.com/srevinsaju/guiscrcpy/issues/4#) created by [@logix2](https://github.com/logix2), regarding some problems in dragging panels in the Linux OS, in this case, using the `Meta`, `Super` or `Alt` keys, to use the Desktop Window Manager functionality in moving the Panel.

## Why guiscrcpy?

I have Python as a subject for Class XI, so as a part of it's advanced learning experience,
and because of my daily use of scrcpy, wanted to integrate GUI into the CLIbased app!!
**GUI** stands for Graphical User Interface, and **Py** is not inherited from scrc<b>py</b> but rather from <b>Py</b> for Python


## Future Releases
Surely, guiscrcpy has great scope of improvement.
Compared to paid Screen Mirroring software, scrcpy gives
a lot of advantages, but my future plans are as follows
* ~~Fix HOME_key, BACK_key. (Will have to wait until @rom1v examines my work)~~ Fixed!
* ~~Add better UI support with adb functions out of scrcpy~~ Fixed again!
* Support python3.8.
* Add service running indicator
* ~~Create pre-built installer and files, Will try fbs build system, after a quite while~~ Fixed!

## Changelog

### Build 1.10.0
#### Highlights
##### New logo for guiscrcpy
The new logo for `guiscrcpy` has been deployed, licensed under *Creative Commons License Attribution 4.0*. A comparison between old and new. <p>
<img src="/ui/android_circle.png" width=49%> <img src="/ui/guiscrcpy_logo.png"  width=49%>
##### New UI and distributed controls
The new UI aims for faster ergonomics and consumer oriented. Individual modules, now are separate from scrcpy executable to provide speed to the mirroring system. The new UI also looks way better than the old one ;) <p>
